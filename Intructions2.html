        <li>Prepare the Marinade:

In a large mixing bowl, combine yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, vegetable oil, gram flour, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, cumin powder, coriander powder, and salt.
Mix well to form a smooth marinade.</li>
<li> the Paneer:

Add the paneer cubes to the marinade, ensuring they are well-coated.
Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight for the best results.</li>
<li>Preheat the Oven:

Preheat your oven to 200°C (392°F) or the grill setting if using an oven.</li>
<li>Prepare the Skewers:

<li> the Paneer Tikka:

Place the skewers on a baking tray lined with parchment paper.
Bake in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes, turning occasionally, until the paneer is slightly charred and cooked through. You can also grill them on a stovetop grill or BBQ.</li>

Remove from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes.
Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and serve with lemon wedges and mint chutney.<li>
