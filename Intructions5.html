        Instructions:
1. Prepare the Bhaji:
Cook the Base:

Heat butter or oil in a large pan over medium heat.
Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.
Add finely chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.
Add bell pepper and green chilies, and cook for another 2-3 minutes.
Add Ginger-Garlic Paste:

Add ginger-garlic paste and sauté for a minute until the raw smell disappears.
Cook Tomatoes:

Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they become soft and the oil starts to separate from the masala.
Add Spices:

Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, pav bhaji masala, cumin powder, coriander powder, and salt. Mix well.
Add Vegetables:

Add the boiled and mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables. Mix thoroughly and cook for 5-7 minutes.
Mash the Bhaji:

Use a potato masher to mash the vegetables and blend the mixture. You can add a little water if the bhaji is too thick. Adjust the seasoning and let it simmer for another 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Finish and Garnish:

Garnish with chopped fresh coriander leaves.
2. Prepare the Pav:
Heat a griddle or tawa over medium heat.
Slice the pav rolls horizontally but not all the way through.
Spread butter on the inner sides of the pav rolls and toast them on the griddle until golden brown and crispy.
3. Serve:
Serve the hot bhaji with buttered pav rolls.
Garnish with extra coriander leaves, a wedge of lemon, and a dollop of butter if desired.
You can also serve with sliced onions and a side of pickles.
Enjoy your delicious Pav Bhaji!
