        nstructions:
1. Prepare the Batter:
Soak the Ingredients:

Wash the rice thoroughly and soak it in water for about 4-6 hours.
Wash the urad dal and fenugreek seeds, then soak them together in water for about 4-6 hours.
Grind the Batter:

Drain the soaked urad dal and fenugreek seeds, and grind them in a blender or wet grinder, adding water as needed, until you get a smooth and fluffy batter.
Drain the soaked rice and grind it separately to a smooth paste, adding water as needed.
Mix and Ferment:

Combine the ground rice and urad dal batters in a large bowl. Add salt and mix well.
Cover the bowl with a lid and let the batter ferment in a warm place for 8-12 hours or overnight, until it doubles in volume and turns slightly sour.
2. Cook the Dosa:
Check the Batter:

After fermentation, the batter should be airy and thick. Stir it gently, and if it seems too thick, add a little water to achieve a pourable consistency.
Heat the Pan:

Heat a non-stick or cast-iron tawa (griddle) over medium heat. Test the heat by sprinkling a few drops of water on the surface; if it sizzles and evaporates, the pan is ready.
Spread the Batter:

Pour a ladleful of batter onto the center of the tawa. Using the back of the ladle, spread the batter in a circular motion from the center outwards to form a thin, even dosa.
Cook the Dosa:

Drizzle a few drops of oil or ghee around the edges and on top of the dosa.
Cook until the edges start to lift and the bottom turns golden brown and crisp. You can cook it on one side or flip it for a crispier texture.
Serve:

Fold or roll the dosa and serve it hot with coconut chutney, sambar, or a potato masala filling.
Enjoy your homemade crispy dosa!
