    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <p>
1. Prepare the Chana Dal:
Rinse the chana dal thoroughly and soak it in water for 2-3 hours. Drain and set aside.
2. Make the Batter:
In a food processor or blender, coarsely grind the soaked and drained chana dal. It should be a mix of slightly coarse and smooth textureâ€”don't make it too fine.

Transfer the ground chana dal to a mixing bowl. Add finely chopped onions, green chilies, ginger, coriander leaves, cumin seeds, fennel seeds (if using), turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala, baking soda (if using), and salt. Mix well.

3. Fry the Pakodas:
Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat.

Drop spoonfuls of the batter into the hot oil, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Fry the pakodas in batches if needed.

Fry until they are golden brown and crispy on all sides, about 4-5 minutes.

Use a slotted spoon to remove the pakodas and drain them on paper towels to remove excess oil.

4. Serve:
Serve hot with green chutney, tamarind chutney, or ketchup.
Enjoy your crispy Chana Pakodas!
