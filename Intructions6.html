        Instructions:
Prepare the Rice:

Wash the basmati rice under running water until the water runs clear.
Soak the rice in water for 20-30 minutes, then drain and set aside.
Sauté the Spices:

Heat ghee or oil in a large pot or deep pan over medium heat.
Add bay leaf, cloves, cinnamon stick, green cardamoms, and cumin seeds. Sauté for a few seconds until fragrant.
Cook the Onions and Chilies:

Add the thinly sliced onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.
Add the slit green chilies and ginger-garlic paste. Sauté for another 2-3 minutes until the raw smell disappears.
Add the Vegetables:

Add the chopped mixed vegetables to the pot and sauté for 5-7 minutes until they start to soften.
Add Spices and Rice:

Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala, and salt. Mix well.
Add the soaked and drained rice to the pot, and gently mix to coat the rice with the spices and vegetables.
Cook the Pulao:

Pour in 2 cups of water or vegetable broth. Stir gently and bring to a boil.
Once it starts boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a lid, and cook for 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is fully cooked and the water is absorbed.
Fluff the rice with a fork and let it sit covered for another 5 minutes.
Garnish and Serve:

Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and fried onions or cashews if desired.
Serve hot with raita, yogurt, or pickle.
Enjoy your delicious Vegetable Pulao!
